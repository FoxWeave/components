Twilio is a telephony service, allowing you to make and receive phone calls, as well as send and receive SMS messages. <a href="http://www.foxweave.com/apps-and-dbs/twilio">See online docs for more details (and demos)</a>.

Configuring the Twilio output connector is quite simple:
<ol>
    <li>Select the <strong>Twilio Account</strong> (press the <img src="/images/add.png"/> button to add an account, if needed).</li>
    <li>Select the <strong>Twilio Action</strong> that you wish to sync/migrate to the selected account.</li>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Data Mapping</strong> tab and map the pipeline data into the Zendesk object (selected in step #2).</li>
</ol>
