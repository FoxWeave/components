Oracle is a very popular Relational Database. <a href="http://www.foxweave.com/apps-and-dbs/oracle/">See online docs for more details (and demos)</a>.
<p/>
Configuring the Oracle output connector is quite simple:
<ol>
    <li>Select the <strong>Oracle Server</strong> (press the <img src="/images/add.png"/> button to add an account, if needed).</li>
    <li>Enter the name of the <strong>Table</strong> to which you wish to synchronize data.</li>
    <li>Enter the Table column names, as well as the type information for each column.  This should match the definition
        from the database itself.</li>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Add / Update</strong> tab and configure how you would like the data to be added to the table.</li>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Data Mapping</strong> tab and configure the data mappings.</li>
</ol>
